# Pyramid of Luck
 
## Description

This project is a simple solution that my mother-in-law asked me, She needed to generate some numbers using an initial value, the flow is simple, It is just to
add each pair of number starting from the left and if the number is of two digits you just take the last one, you continue with this proccess until you reach the end of the number.
